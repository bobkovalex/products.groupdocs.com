    content: "GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET APIs help you create powerful applications in C#, ASP.NET ‎and other .NET-based technologies, which can render and display documents and images of 170+ file ‎formats without installing any external software. The file viewer library rasterizes the documents and then converts them into SVG+HTML+CSS to optimize the overall document rendering experience for viewing business documents, images, ‎text files, diagrams, graphics, email attachments and PDF files with speed, true-text and high-fidelity inside your applications. You have the option to add document viewing and reading functionalities in your applications to display ‎whole document, partial document, specific page/cell range, individual document layer, with or ‎without annotations and comments for the supported file formats.‎
    <br><br>
    GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET caches the rendered documents output to the local disk by default. Any type of external cache storage is also supported by implementing appropriate interfaces – Amazon S3, Dropbox, Google Drive, Windows Azure, Redis or any other. "
